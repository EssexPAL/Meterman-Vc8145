        Usage:
                -d:n         n = the delay, in mS, before the first measurement is made.
                -s:n         n = the number of samples to be taken.
                -a:n         n = the number of samples to be averaged without a window of acceptability
                -w:n         n = the window of sample acceptabilty in percent i.e. if this value is 10 then
                                 only samples with 10% of the centre sample will be included in the average.
                -i:n         n = the delay, in mS, after each sample has been taken.
                -h or /?     Show this help.
                -p:COMn      n = Com port number in use - e.g. to use com 3 -p:COM3
                -fs:n        n = ASCII value of Field seperator e.g. fs:9 is tab character.
                -m:"Message" The text message should be replaced with any text that you wish to include
                             in the output.  Surround text with spaces by double quotes.
                -fn:filename The filename that the reading will be saved to.  If the filename contains spaces
                             then it should be surrounded with double quotation marks.  If the filename is
                             not specified then the output will go to the command line (Stdout).
                -fo:format   Numbers, comma separated, representing the fields to be included in the output.
                             e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6
                             The fields are as follows:  1 Date
                                                         2 Time

        Defaults:       -d  = 250mS
                        -s  = 3 samples
                        -a  = 0 window only average
                        -w  = average window 10 (percent)

        examples:       Vc8145Cli -d:100 -s:10 -w:25 -i:100 -p:COM3 -fs:9 -mTest -fn:Test.Txt -fo: 0,1,2,3
                        This example will display the Date, Time, user message and reading.  The measurement
                        will have pre and post reading delays of 100mS, ten samples will be taken with an
                        acceptability window of 25%.  The field separator character is a tab, the user
                        message is Test and the filename is Test.Txt

                        Vc8145Cli -d:1250 -s:8 -a:6 -i:100 -p:COM3 -fs:0x44 -mTest -fn:Testing.Txt -fo: 0,1,2,6
                        This example will display the user message, reading, reading type and status.
                        The pre sample delay is 1250mS, the post sample delay is 100mS, six samples will be taken
                        and averaged without an acceptability window.  The field separator character is a comma,
                        the user message is Test and the fi1lename is Testing.Txt.

                        Vc8145Cli -p:COM6
                        With the meter on COM6, set to AC Volts, select pressed once and no input connections,
                        the returned string will look similar to the one below:

                        14/09/19,08:44:01.123,Vc8145,15,1, 2.5467999,V AC,,,,49.8900032,Hz

        Information:    The Vc8145 can only provide readings at the rate of approxamately 4 per second.
                        Whilst the serial port can collect readings at a greater rate any collections that
                        occur with a gap of less than 250mS are likely to be a repeat of the previous one.
