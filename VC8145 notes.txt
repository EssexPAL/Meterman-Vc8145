The RS232 implementation on the VC8154 is not complete, the result of this is that
it may not work, properly or at all, on RS232 ports, USB connected or built in.  
The primary problem is that the transmit signal from the VC8145 swings only
between 0v and 5v, it should swing between a minimum of -3 to +3v.  
The result is that when the VC8145 replies to a received message it is not seen
by the port or it is corrupted, this is dependent upon the manufacturer of the port.
I have a few different USB->RS232 devices and the only one that works reliably
is the Easysync USB-2COM-M, I would expect other Easysync converters to be ok.  
The best fix is, make/buy (from eBay or elsewhere) a small converter board, 
and fit it internally to the instrument so that RS232 is properly implemented.   

The other option is to buy a USB-> Serial board and fit that that making the 
meter USB accessible. Once again beware of signals being inverted.

WARNING - most of the RS232 chips will invert the transmit signal so you will
need to invert between the instrument and the converter board.
